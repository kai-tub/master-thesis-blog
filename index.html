I will use this blog to order my thoughts throughout
my master thesis and create intermediate draft writings of
my actual thesis paper.
The idea of writing a blog was inspired by the book [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and
PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C2KM7NR/)

The blog will consists of two main machine learning topics,
which will be combined in my master thesis:

1. Remote Image Sensing with multispectral images
2. Self-supervised computer vision approaches

All blog posts will be written as
[jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
The code used to generate the shown images are always
accesible via the GitHub badge, revealing the complete
source code. This style of writing blogs with notebooks was
made possible by [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).
