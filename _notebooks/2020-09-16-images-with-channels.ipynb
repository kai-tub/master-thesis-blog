    "In the previous [post](https://kai-tub.github.io/master-thesis-blog/images/2020/09/02/introduction.html), \n",
    "we took a closer look at grayscale images and how they are encoded on the computer. But these types of images are boring... \n",
    "Images with color are nicer to look at and carry more information for us. In the following, we will examine RGB images and what the difference is between those images and multi-spectral images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Short recap: Grayscale images\n",
    "To summarize our findings from the previous [post](https://kai-tub.github.io/master-thesis-blog/images/2020/09/02/introduction.html): We have seen that every image consists of pixels. These pixels are nothing more than numbers stored as binary values on the disk. Depending on how many bits we use per pixel, we can tune the number of distinct colors (color-depth). Besides adjusting the color-depth, we also tuned the resolution. With a higher resolution, we can show *more details*. Remember, with a single pixel, we can only encode a single color, but with many pixels, we can capture scenes and objects!\n",
    "\n",
    "## RGB images\n",
    "So how do we add color information to our images? If we think back to art class, we may remember [*primary colors*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_color). Red, green, and blue can be combined to create any color. Because we work with displays and light emitting from them, we *additively mix* the primary colors.{% fn 1 %} Each of these three colors has its own *channel*. In the previous grayscale examples, there was only a single channel for our gray values.\n",
    "Now we use three channels instead of one. These three channels are *combined* and presented to us in an additive manner. \n",
    "A close-up image of an LCD screen helps us to understand how we *create* colors on our screen."
