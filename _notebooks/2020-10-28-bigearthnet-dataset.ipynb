    "In the previous post, [understanding spectral reflectance](https://kai-tub.github.io/master-thesis-blog/images/2020/10/14/understanding-spectral-reflectance.html), we saw that objects could be differentiated by their surface reflectance. The surface reflectance can be sensed as multi-spectral images from satellites. In the following post, we will examine the Sentinel-2 mission and the resulting data. Afterwards, we will review an example remote sensing dataset, BigEarthNet.\n",

    "[Sentinel-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-2) is an earth-observation mission and consists of two satellites\n",
    "Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B. Both of which are operated by the European Space Agency ([ESA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency)). The task is to gather multi-spectral data for climate change, agriculture monitoring, and emergency management. The data is published under a free and open data policy, making it valuable for academic purposes.\n",

    "The revisit frequency is also called the temporal resolution.\n",
    "The spatial resolution is reported as $XX\\,\\text{m}$, which refers to the length and height of a pixel. So a resolution of 10m would correspond to a single pixel capturing an area of 10m x 10m, or 100m². An example remote sensing image can be seen in the following figure. The Sentinel-2 satellites have a spatial resolution of 10m (four visible and near-infrared), 20m (six red edge and short-wave infrared), and 60m (three atmospheric correction) bands. {% cite Sentinel2SpatialResolution %}\n",

    "In total, thirteen bands are sensed, ranging from the visible/near-infrared (VNIR) to the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum. Each band has effectively 16-bits per channel, or as it is commonly referred to in the remote image sensing community, a *radiometric resolution* of 16-bits. The term *radiometric resolution* highlights the domain in which the images are used but is no different from _bits per channel_{% fn 1 %}.\n",

    "ESA introduced Band _8A_ in the Sentinel-2 mission as band 08 was too contaminated by water vapor and insensitive to other parameters for some applications. But, the original sensor for band 08 remained in the sensory equipment. \n",

The [official website](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/resolutions/radiometric) writes a radiometric resolution of 12-bits per channel, but the information is out of date. [Inspection of images](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/233874/what-is-the-range-of-values-of-sentinel-2-level-2a-images) starting around 2016 reveals a resolution of at least 15-bits. But the full 16-bit range is used to encode special values. As the data will always end-up using 2 Bytes for storage (16-bits), it is commonly treated as a 16-bit image. I tried my best to comprehend the data range fully, but there are still some open questions. I am trying to answer these questions and have an open discussion on [gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/376711/understanding-value-range-for-sentinel-2-images).
